# Lua 5.3 in Rust

# How to get started

  * Install rust (needs to be a nightly)
    * curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    * rustup default nightly
  * `cargo b` to build
  * `cargo test` to run the tests

# Working on stuff

 * Send Alex your github username to be added to the repo to push branches (so you don't have to work from a fork).
 * Please don't push to master unless the tests pass!
